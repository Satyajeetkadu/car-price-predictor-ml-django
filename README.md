CAR PRICE PREDICTION:-


Welcome to the Car Price Prediction project! I'm excited to share with you the journey of building this web application that accurately predicts used car prices using machine learning. Let's dive into the details!

Data Collection:-


To kick off this project, I collected a comprehensive dataset of used car listings from Quikr Car. The dataset, which you can find here : https://github.com/rajtilakls2510/car_price_predictor/blob/master/quikr_car.csv
, provided a wealth of information about various car features like make, model, year, mileage, and fuel type. This diverse dataset served as the foundation for training our machine learning model.

Data Cleaning and Analysis:-

Before we could start training our machine learning model, it was crucial to clean and analyze the data. I dedicated considerable time to handling missing values, removing outliers, and ensuring the data's consistency. Through an in-depth analysis, I gained valuable insights into the relationships between different car features and their impact on pricing. This analysis guided our decision-making process during model development.

Machine Learning Model:-

I chose to utilize linear regression as the machine learning model for car price prediction. This model offered simplicity and interpretability, aligning perfectly with our project's goals. To handle categorical variables, I employed one-hot encoding to convert them into numerical representations. Additionally, I created efficient pipelines to streamline the data preprocessing and model training steps.

Model Evaluation
Evaluating the performance of our machine learning model was crucial to ensure accurate predictions. To achieve this, I used the R-squared (R2) score as the evaluation metric. The R2 score allowed me to measure the model's ability to explain the variance in the car prices. The higher the R2 score, the better the model fit. By using this metric, I gained insights into the model's predictive capabilities and accuracy.

User-friendly Interface
The Car Price Prediction web application boasts a user-friendly interface that simplifies the process of obtaining car price predictions. By inputting key car details such as Company, model, year, kms_driven, and fuel type, users can receive accurate price predictions. I designed the application with the aim of empowering users to make informed decisions when buying or selling used cars.
